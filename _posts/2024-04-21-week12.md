I would think that The Cathedral and the Bazaar is an interesting essay to read and re-read every few years. Certainly, reading it in 2024 and comparing it's initial appraisal of the Linux kernel as a Cathedral model to the project's current form I'd say: Bingo bam 100% you nailed it. The distinction between the Cathedral model and the Bazaar model, one of a unifed, 'sacred' central guiding force to be given tribute(patch files), as opposed to an open exchange of contributions where the projects direction is more evenly distrbuted, applies heavily to a project like Linux, and similarly in our age of corporate-backed open source projects like Meta's React, Google's Kubernetes, Microsofts...Windows Calculator(No no they have TypeScript), there is a clear attraction and adherence to the Cathedral model. If anything, it feels like more and more projects are adopting this model, as the internet and the commoditization of Open Source( where developers are encouraged to 'stand out' in the job market by contributing to open source projects ) have caused there to be a glut of project contributors that may or may not be interested in the project itself, or understanding how it works at all.

Our group is nearing the end of our project with gitlab and I remain pleased with our overall experience. The community is very welcoming, the codebase is extremely well documented and the issue tracker is abundant with issues that range from trivial to complex. I think our main challenege to overcome is to break past just rearranging code, and try and contribute something akin to a feature. But for the time being that is more of a stretch goal then a core necessity
