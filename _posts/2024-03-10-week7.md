I think that the origins of open source are idealistic and good for humanity! The motivations of the FOSS movement were prinicpally
the fair, free and equal dissemenation of information, for the goal of benefiting others. Today, it's less idealistic, and more platformed by corporations seeking to profit, which is distressing, but better than nothing! Considering google and meta are the principal maintainers of many of the most commonly used open source projects, like go, docker, react, and so on, I don't think that the original proponents of the movement would have wanted corporate interests to be so deeply vested in open source projects, but I think many of them would have understood that people need to make money.

I liked learning about Red Hat because they were an example of a company that was able to distribute and develop FOSS software(fedora linux) to a degree that they probably wouldn't have been able to if they weren't profitting, so it was good to see that corporate interests aren't totally destructive to FOSS projects.

Our project group development is slow, as we had chosen the brave browser as our project but realized that it's pretty much impossible to contribute to the codebase unless you're an employee. We have since reconvened and are pretty sure we're going to work on P5.jS!
