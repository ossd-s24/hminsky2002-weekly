Our in class discussion regarding non-code open source projects was a fun look at extending the principles of open source beyond software, though I think most of the projects themselves were still tangentially software related. I guess that's because the ideas, or at least the modern day 'movement', came from the context of code and technology. Nonetheless, some stuff that stood out to me were NYC open data and Dungeons and Dragons(at least originially). The city adopting an open data policy really feels like a meaningful implementation of open source ideals and one that can and does have a huge presence. Dungeons and Dragons being open source is cool because I love the idea of a game anyone can build or play for free. It reminds me of like learning card games. Once you learn a card game, nobody can charge you to play it(beyond the cost of a pack of cards)

We as a group are winding down our gitlab contribution project with a degree of relief and personally I have a lot of pride in what we were able to accomplish. Though our contributions were mostly housekeeping tasks, we still were able to make contributions(that were appreciated) to a very large code base in the course of only a few weeks! I am excited to present our experience this week and look forward to continuing to contribute post-grad.
