## Open Source Outside of Code
The Food Computer and Farming for the Future videos showcased an application of open source development principles outside of software. I thought the videos were effective at showing, through explicit examples of the students and classrooms, how open source principles were effective at distributing information rapidly and equitably. It was great to see students introducted to agricultural concepts at a young age in a hands-on way, tackling the problem of a dwindling agricultural workforce and providing an enagaging and rewarding project for the students.

I think the key elements of open source that took hold in classrooms were 
    1. The ability to distribute the source code and instructions for the agricultural projects, such that many teachers in many different envirionments could introduce them to their classes
    2. The community of likeminded students and teachers working on the same projects
All this to say, I think it is great to engaged students working on meaningful projects and I am happy that the open source principles behind the Food Computer-type projects are effective.

I have begun contributing to small projects on my own time-->my first non-class contribution was to the free code camp code base, which was just a grammatical fix, but it felt good to go through the motions of following a new orginzations contributing guidelines. I am excited to keep contributing, and right now am focusing my efforts on finding a project that I want to spend a more significant time working on.
