As we pass the midpoint of the semester, I can reflect on the rocky road to contribution for my group project. I think we started out poorly by choosing a project that we had not vetted thoroughly enough, BRAVE, and finding out too late that we needed to pay for services to contribute as non-team members. Then, we floundered around a bit unsure of which project to contribute to, but I am happy where we have ended up, in the gitlab project.

I think, and this applies broadly to any project I've been a part of, we are only able to get out of each project what we put into it, multiplied by some factor that is specific to the project. Contributing to a heavily curated project like Brave, or even a corporate backed project like gitlab, requires a lot of effort in terms of communication between us as students to the development team. As a baseline, interest in the project needs to be repeatedly demonstrated to show commitment. Then, to remain active and available in the community requires consistent outreach. It makes sense, of course, but it's a strong consideration when working on collaborative projects. How much time can you put into the project not just in terms of development, but in terms of being a part of the team. Nonetheless, I am pleased to have been able to make a contribution to gitlab, and am quite happy with the response rate and friendliness of the team so far!
