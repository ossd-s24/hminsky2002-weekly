After looking at the project evaluations and doing my own, I have become more nervous and more excited about contributing to open source.

The more established and flashy a project is, typically the harder it is to make significant contributions. Some of my peers evaluated projects like pandas and scikit-learn, which are great in terms of project organization, but have been developed so extensively that I feel daunted at the idea of contributing to them. Not that this is a bad thing! I look forward to being challenged by my semester-long project, but it does make it hard to choose a project to sink my teeth into

I think that I am mostly just excited to settle on a project and focus my efforts. I am nervous about being able to contribute meaningfully, but one positive thing I've taken away is that for most open source projects, it seems like if you put in the effort to communicate with the main development team you can always find SOME way to contribute. But it's about putting in that extra leg of effort.
