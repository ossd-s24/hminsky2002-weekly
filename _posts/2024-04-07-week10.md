title: Week 10

Working on the gitlab project has been an enjoyable introduction to the world of Open Source, specifically 
the realm of corporate backed projects. Now that we enter week 3 of participation in the community, I've found 
that my initial speculation on contribution has been proven correct: OSS communities are only as responsive as you are active.

We've been able to commit two contributions to the gitlab codebase so far, mostly in the realm of refactoring and linting, but it's a nice introduction to the project to get to be able to work on these backlog tasks. There is also a level of realization involved in the contributions that sometimes even when a task seems simple, part of the reason it's still an open issue is that the fix isn't trivial. In linting large amounts of the codebase, I've found many tasks that seem like instant fixes that then break the codebase, and require a reasonable amount of trial and error to fix, such as implementing a rule that limits the number of parameters a class takes to a constant amount.

I'm hoping that by the end of the semester, our team is able to make a few more sizable contributions, and what I'm really looking forward to is continuing to contribute to the project after graduation. As school itself is ending soon, I appreciate the opporunity to work on something that will persist after I'm out of the classroom.
