I came into this assignment with an idea for a browser extension, and my teammates agreed
to work on this idea, so I was very happy to work on it. I think I often
fall into the pattern of working on things myself because it feels easier than
communicating with others about exact details, but this assignment was a reminder that that doesn't always work.

This assignment was principaly an introduction to developing software for a specific platform. I'm used to making hacky web-apps for class and friends that have much looser guidelines(if it works it works) whereas publishing a browser extension has both structural and stylistic requirements. First understanding the nuances of background scripts, content scripts and permissions, and further combining different js functionalities to get the desired results was an involved and informative process.
Additionally, I published our extension on the marketplace afterwards, and that required
fitting the project even further into the acceptable guidelines for the marketplace.

I really enjoyed the creativity and ideas from the other teams, it seemed like most
other groups took this as an opportunity to have fun and learn. I was a huge fan 
of Tyler1Ify, i thought that was an inspired presentation.
