## On the Code of Conduct
Most teams I have participated in have had codes of conducts. In my highschool theater troupe at the start of each year we all contributed to a big document our thoughts on what our community standards should be and then we would all sign it.
In my college theater troupe, we do that same thing, but I do feel like it's a little
less impacftul.

Now that I'm in my twenties, I think that if people are intending to do disruptive or hurtful things, a code of conduct isn't really going to stop them. Or at least, I think this more than I did in grade school, when we had more teachers actively enforcing behavioral standards. 

This is not to say I think that code's of conduct aren't helpful. From our class excercise on Wednesday, I think some of the key takeaways from looking at the CoC's of
various projects were:
    1. The presence of a CoC is a sign that the project team is considerate of communal standards
    2. It is useful to be able to cite a CoC as evidence if you feel someone is being harmful to the community
    3. It is a good way to get a sense of how people in the project opperate, and if you think the project would be one you would want to be a part of
   
I don't think there are any universally effective techniques of enforcing these standards, but its a solid foundation, especially for new members, to have a thorough understanding of the agreement.

As a last note, I also found out that the [Python Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/) has a weapons policy
```
Weapons Policy:
No weapons are allowed at Python Software Foundation events.
```
Sometimes you really can't be too explicit
