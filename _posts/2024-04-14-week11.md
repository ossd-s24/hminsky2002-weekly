Christopher's presentation was another cool way to see personal and emotional motivation behind open source projects. Emotional attachement and commitment to open source ideals has been one of the main things I've learned about OSS this semester, specficially that many of the foundation of open source prinicples were built with the intention of 'doing good.' Which is cool! And seems like what Tidepool is doing. 

It's also interesting to hear another example of about how the concepts of open source can be applied outside of pure software. The way he framed Tidepool's mission as 'radical transparency' made me think about how part of what's important about open source is highlighting the issues with closed source projects, such as the current front runners in the diabetes technology industry. I firmly believe we should not allow these types of concentrations of proprietary information where companies can arbitrarily price otherwise inaccessible information, ESPECIALLY in the realm of health care.

Gitlab group work remains moderately productive. I've gotten in 4 contributions so far, all of which have been housekeeping realted(linting and refactoring) but I enjoy being a part of the community. I was able to attend the community office hours and take directly with two CORE members, who are contributors who act as bridges between the community and employees. It's a nice time!
